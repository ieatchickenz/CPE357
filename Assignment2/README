This program..... sucks. No way around it it just does. I got my hash table
running for the most part except for resizing. My read_long_word acts a little
funcky at the end of files. I did not have enough time to figure out how to
include flags or stdin so the program only works "./fw filename"....with files
that are small enough.

It can't even compile because I was trying to make header files and failed
utterly
